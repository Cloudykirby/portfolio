        <p>
          Born and raised in New York, I graduated with a BA in Finance with a
          minor in Psychology at Baruch College. I found a passion in software
          engineering and I graduated from FullStack academy. I began my journey
          in software engineering in March of 2020. I was trying to learn python
          on my own, though Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw. When I
          realized how much I enjoyed coding, so I decided to take the plunge
          and switch fields.
